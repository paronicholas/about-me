# lab2-about-me
This project is a website about me, Nick Paro. It is intended to provide basic information about myself through various methods - a quick statement of who I am and what I do, my educational history, and a brief work history (not all encompassing).

It next goes through a five question guessing game to learn few more personal details about various things I like, in a fun way.

Then it lists my top ten favorite movies. This list is bound to change, but give's a good idea of the scope of movies which interest me.

On top of giving information about me, this site is also intended to showcase my developing skills in HTML5, CSS3, and (vanilla) JavaScript. This does this by showcasing design techniques using CSS3 to make the webpage look cool, refining the structure of the HTML to represent a more professional design, and to show my understanding of JavaScript application to a webpage in order to make it both interact and unique. The page also highlights my ability to manipulate the page's HTML tags through the use of JavaScript.
